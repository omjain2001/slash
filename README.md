## ðŸ’¿: Deprecated Feature

We removed the command line interface as the UI is easier for the average user.

# :golf: How to Use the UI

There is a search bar that users will see when opening this application. Simply type the desired item in the box.

<p align="center"><img width="500" src="./assets/Slash_Search.png"></p>

<p align="center"><img width="300" src="./assets/Slash_Sort.png"></p>

# :muscle: What's next for future development?

<p align="center"><img width="700" src="./assets/SlashAnimation.gif"></p>

- Creating ordering and payment functionality for customers to directly order from command line
- Take coupons or promo codes into consideration
- Provide parameters like in-store availability or inventory
- Increase the number of filters.
- Add login for the web version.
- Host on a docker container

## :thought_balloon: Use Case

- **_Students_**: Students coming to university are generally on a budget and time constraint and generally spend hours wasting time searching for products on Websites. Slash is the perfect tool for these students that slashes all the unnecessary details on a website and helps them get prices for a product across multiple websites. Make the most of this tool in the upcoming Black Friday Sale.
- **_Data Analysts_**: Finding data for any project is a tedious job for a data analyst, and the datasets found might not be the most recent one. Using slash, they can create their own dataset in real time and format it as per their needs so that they can focus on what is actually important. On top of this, finding data can be easily automated to suit the data analysts needs.

## :page_facing_up: Why

- In a market where we are spoilt for choices, we often look for the best deals.
- The ubiquity of internet access has leveled the retail playing field, making it easy for individuals and businesses to sell products without geographic limitation. In 2020, U.S. e-commerce sales, receiving a boost due to the COVID-19 pandemic, grew 44% and represented more than 21% of total retail sales, according to e-commerce information source Internet Retailer.
- The growth of e-commerce has not only changed the way customers shop, but also their expectations of how brands approach customer service, personalize communications, and provide customers choices.
- E-commerce market has prompted cutthroat competition amongst dealers, which is discernable through the price patterns for products of major market players. Price cuts are somewhat of a norm now and getting the best deal for your money can sometimes be a hassle (even while online shopping).
- This is what Slash aims to reduce by giving you an easy-to-use, all-in-one-place solution for finding the best deals for your products that major market dealers have to offer!
- Slash in its current form is for people who have some understanding of Python and are comfortable with using the command line interface to interact with systems.
- Future updates aim to encompass a wide variety of users irrespective of their computer knowledge and background.

# :bulb: Motivation

We saw potential in this as e-commerce is a very common tool that people use to buy online. Even so, it can be hard to find the best item based on ratings and prices. This usually requires several tabs for Amazon, Walmart, and other stores. With Slash, this can be made easy, which resonated with the group. We strived to add to this as we would like a fully functioning version of Slash in order to make shopping online easier.
